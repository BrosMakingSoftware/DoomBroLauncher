<![CDATA[Doom has a simple plot, its background is given in the instruction manual, and the in-game story advances mainly through short messages displayed between the game's episodes.

The player takes the role of a marine (unnamed to further represent the person playing), one of Earth's toughest, hardened in combat and trained for action, who has been incarcerated on Mars after assaulting a senior officer when ordered to fire upon civilians. There, he works alongside the Union Aerospace Corporation (UAC), a multi-planetary conglomerate and military contractor performing secret experiments on interdimensional travel. Recently, the teleportation has shown signs of anomalies and instability, but the research continues nonetheless.

Suddenly, something goes wrong and creatures from hell swarm out of the teleportation gates on Deimos and Phobos. A defensive response from base security fails to halt the invasion, and the bases are quickly overrun by monsters; all personnel are killed or turned into zombies.

A military detachment from Mars travels to Phobos to investigate the incident. The player is tasked with securing the perimeter, as the assault team and their heavy weapons are brought inside. Radio contact soon ceases and the player realizes that he is the only survivor. Being unable to pilot the shuttle off of Phobos by himself, the only way to escape is to go inside and fight through the complexes of the moon base.]]>

<![CDATA[The player once again takes the role of the Marine, an unnamed hero, who, after being stranded on Phobos and subsequently fighting his way out of Deimos and Hell itself, returns back home to Earth - only to find that it too has fallen victim to an invasion from Hell.

With all the major cities in the world in ruins, the remaining leaders plan to use spacecrafts to transport the survivors of Earth's population. However, the starport is the only way for the ships to depart and the demons have protected it with a force field. All of humanity's remaining soldiers make a desperate assault on the starport, but eventually they are decimated and only the player remains.

The Marine manages to enter the infested starport, slay all the demons in his way and is able to shut down the force field. Humanity is able to escape, and he sits quietly waiting for death, knowing he saved his species.

Then, the remaining humans have discovered the source of the hellish invasion: the Marine's own hometown. He gets back into the fight and exterminates the hellspawn from the town, and finds another entryway into hell.

To close the portal, he must enter hell again to stop the invasion. After journeying through its twisted surface, the Marine manages to confront the Icon of Sin, a gigantic demon, and kills it. Its gruesome death causes devastation on Hell, and the portal to Earth has been sealed.]]>

<![CDATA[In TNT: Evilution the UAC once again are intent on developing and experimenting with dimensional gateway technology. They set up a base on Io, one of the moons of Jupiter, with a solid detachment of space marines for protection. The marines do their job well: when the first experimental gateway is opened they annihilate the forces of Hell. Anything that came through the gateway was immediately destroyed by the marines, and so research on the gateways continued.

Later, the yearly supply ship came earlier than expected, and looks strange and unusually large on the radar. The personnel of the base go out to behold the terrible truth: it is a spaceship from Hell, built of steel, stone, flesh, bone and corruption. The ship's enormous gates open to unleash a rain of demons on the base. Quickly, the whole base is overrun, and everyone is slain or zombified.

The Doomguy, now in command of the marine deployment, has been away on a walk, and has thus escaped death or zombification. After being attacked by an imp he rushes back to the base, where he sees the demonic spaceship still hovering above it and realizes what has happened. Then he swears that he will seek vengeance for his slain troops, and sets out to kill as many evil creatures as possible.

In the end, the marine defeats the Demon-Spitter, and the game describes Something rumbles in the distance. A blue light begins to glow inside the ruined skull of the Demon-Spitter.]]>

<![CDATA[After Hell's catastrophic invasion of Earth, the global governments decide to take measures against any possible future invasion, knowing that the powers of Hell still remain strong. The UAC corporation is refounded under completely new management (the old trustees and stockholders are all dead in any case) and aims to develop tools that would prevent demonic invasions. It is said that the new UAC base is on one of Jupiter's moons, Io. UAC's scientists thought that this distance from Earth might prevent another catastrophic invasion, but as the events of TNT: Evilution showed, this was not the case. Something else would be needed.

UAC's scientists start working on quantum accelerator devices intended to close interdimensional gates and stop possible invasions. The experiments are carried out in a secret research complex, with a stationed detachment of marines. The work seems to be going well, but...

The creatures from Outside have their dire attention drawn towards the new research. A gate opens in the heart of the complex and unnatural horrors pour out. The quantum accelerator performs superbly - the gate is quickly closed and the invasion stopped. Research continues more boldly.

On the next day, a ring of seven gates opens and an even greater invasion commences. For a single hour the quantum accelerators manage to close six of the seven gates... but the hellish army has become too numerous and too strong. The complex is overrun. Everyone present is slain, or zombified. The last gate of Hell remains open, manned and guarded by a demon Gatekeeper.

The Government, frantic that the quantum accelerator will be destroyed or used in some evil alien fashion against humanity, orders all marines to the site at once. Doomguy is the closest one to the site and gets there first. There he concludes that by the time reinforcements arrive that the demons will be too numerous and powerful.
The marine decides to enter the complex and stop the Gatekeeper alone.]]>

<![CDATA[A semi-official 5th episode for The Ultimate Doom.

This project's aim is to bring the official and relatively obscure console-exclusive maps together in a single playable episode. Maps consist of levels from PSXDoom, Jaguar Doom, and the Doom Alphas, re-mastered in a surreal yet fitting "neo-classic" style.

Great effort has been made to preserve the flow of the existing playable maps (PSX maps mostly), though a few in particular are heavily modified for purposes of gameplay or aesthetics. The Alpha maps in particular have changed drastically, but only for the purpose of "completing" what was originally an unfinished map. There is also one mostly-original map, though it does bear some striking similarities to Spawning Vats.

Though many oldschool doomers may not view earlier renditions of these maps (i.e. Kaiser's excellent Consoledoom.wad) as "canon" in the Doom universe, this project is designed specifically to preserve the look and feel of these maps in a format that will sit side-by-side with the original four Id episodes. We hope you will view this project as not just an add-on episode, but the fifth chapter in the Ultimate Doom universe.

Prepare for Evil Unleashed.

You've been morphed into a human! Of course you're out for revenge and have to kick the other members of the Cabal's butts one by one.

In "Black Tower" you're nearing the end of your journey. You and Chagrin, the ruler of the Black Tower, came off the same conveyor belt as newly assembled cyber-demons a few thousand years back.
"Oil runs thicker than blood" the two of you used to say. Demons don't come much closer to friendship than what you and Chagrin shared. Well now your buddy rules the hordes of hell previously under your command and have left you for dead. Your task is simple: Enter the dreaded Black Tower, the nucleus of black magic and the occult in all of Hell, get to its highest floor and slay Chagrin. Then there is the getting back out as well...]]>

You once were the biggest and baddest Cyber-demon to rule hell and you spear-headed the council that governed the underworld; "the Cabal". Betrayed by the other members you find yourself not only dismantled, but also a victim of the utmost demonic humiliation:
You've been morphed into a human! Of course you're out for revenge and have to kick the other members of the Cabal's butts one by one.

"Bloodsea Keep" is the home of your past advisor;
Veavitdpoh (Very Evil Arch-Vile In The Deepest Parts Of Hell). Veavitdpoh is an old-school demon that believes in the rip-out-heart-routine and so shuns all use of technology and mechanical weaponry. His cult following has grown the last century but still amounts to little. Unless you face them alone of course...

After being dumped into the endless "Sea of Blood" following your humiliating transformation into a human you swim for an eternity before you finally bump your head against the pier of the keep. Digging your feet into the mud of human remains your hand brushes by an old blood-soaked shotgun, the previous owner's severed hand still attached to it. All who enter "Bloodsea Keep" with such items fall victim to your former advisor's favourite past-time: Torture. Any "heretics" still alive inside the keep should be homicidal maniacs at best.

"That's OK" you think, "maybe they brought some more ammo for the shotgun", before cocking the rusty pump-action, causing an eyeball to fly out of the cartridge...]]>

Of course you're out for revenge and have to kick the other members of the Cabal's butts one by one.

In Mephisto's Maosoleum you have reached the grave of an old friend and mentor: "Mephisto". Yeah old Lucy was a tough bastard. But then there was that incident with the earthling marine which lost him a lot of credit in the hard-core parts of Hell. So you had to kick him off the throne of course. His immortal spirit was kept as a member of the Cabal though and so he was in on the betrayal against you. Time to enter his tomb and lay the old man down to restfor good...]]>

<![CDATA[MINOS' JUDGEMENT is the 4th Canto in my INFERNO series. In your search for Beatrice, your guide, Virgil (the beatnik space-poet) has just successfully lead you through the First Circle of Hades -- only to bring you to the court of Minos, the Judge of Hell.
"Well," you say, "this is another fine mess you've gotten us into.  Now what?"
Virgil, with his usual loquacity, replies:
"Heh heh."

This is a very large level; good luck.

And pay attention to the lighting detail: it took me hours.]]>

<![CDATA[NESSUS is the 5th Canto in my INFERNO series. Minos decided to grant leniency and not kill you until next week.  In the meantime, having slipped past Cerberus, the top dog, you and Virgil come to a precipice overlooking the river Phlegethon. There, Virgil greets the Minotaur using phrases from an out-of-date "Passport to Demonese" by Charles Berlitz. Enraged at having been asked to remove his panties, the Minotaur falls upon the ground and throws a conniption fit. You grab Virgil and climb down some boulders to the foot of the cliff where Chiron, the chief Centaur, offers to have Nessus carry you across the river on his shoulders.
"Why, that's mighty white of ya'," says Virgil.
"No problem, sailor," says Nessus. "Hop on."

This is primarily a deathmatch level, but it's full of enough surprises to make single play quite challenging.]]>

Betrayed by the other members you find yourself not only dismantled, but also a victim of the utmost demonic humiliation: You've been morphed into a human! Of course you're out for revenge and have to kick the other members of the Cabal's butts one by one.

When the "Express Elevator to Hell" starts descending the renegade Cabal has begun to realize you might be a threat to them, human or not. Half way down the shaft that should have taken you to the deepest pits of Hell, the lift first slows down before it jerks to a halt. Ambush! Survive the initial onslaught and find a gateway out of the now sealed elevator. Tough, but that's the way you like it...

Number of Levels : Two. You'll have a  v e r y  hard time finding the secret level though >:) (there's a hint for you at bottom of this txt-file for if (when?) you give up).
The secret is called "Bad Dream". Try playing it from scratch...

But you've caught up with him again, and he's agreed to lead you through the current way-station (mostly because demons and undead sergeants are not much impressed with Virgil's way with words).
"You can get a lot further with a kind word and a gun then you can a kind word."
"You belong to the NRA, don't you?" Virgil asks.
"No, I'm just a pessimistic pacifist."

This is a deceptively small level, but you'll need to conserve ammo and try not to get shot or chewed on too much, since the stim packs are in scarce supply.]]>

<![CDATA[VIRGIL'S LEAD is the 3rd Canto in my INFERNO series. In your search for Beatrice, you lost your guide Virgil (the beatnik space-poet) while crossing Acheron. But you've caught up with him again, and he's agreed to lead you through the current way-station (mostly because demons and undead sergeants are not much impressed with Virgil's way with words).
"You can get a lot further with a kind word and a gun then you can a kind word."
"You belong to the NRA, don't you?" Virgil asks.
"No, I'm just a pessimistic pacifist."

This is a deceptively small level, but you'll need to conserve ammo and try not to get shot or chewed on too much, since the stim packs are in scarce supply.]]>

<![CDATA[MINOS' JUDGEMENT is the 4th Canto in my INFERNO series. In your search for Beatrice, your guide, Virgil (the beatnik space-poet) has just successfully lead you through the First Circle of Hades -- only to bring you to the court of Minos, the Judge of Hell.
"Well," you say, "this is another fine mess you've gotten us into.  Now what?"
Virgil, with his usual loquacity, replies:
"Heh heh."

This is a very large level; good luck.

And pay attention to the lighting detail: it took me hours.]]>

<![CDATA[This and the other of my wads were to be released inside a 32-level "episode" on the internet. But having id release them is about 666 times cooler.
The plot in the intended episode was as follows:
You once were the biggest and baddest Cyber-demon to rule hell and you spear-headed the council that governed the underworld; "the Cabal". Betrayed by the other members you find yourself not only dismantled, but also a victim of the utmost demonic humiliation:
You've been morphed into a human! Of course you're out for revenge and have to kick the other members of the Cabal's butts one by one.

"Bloodsea Keep" is the home of your past advisor;
Veavitdpoh (Very Evil Arch-Vile In The Deepest Parts Of Hell). Veavitdpoh is an old-school demon that believes in the rip-out-heart-routine and so shuns all use of technology and mechanical weaponry. His cult following has grown the last century but still amounts to little. Unless you face them alone of course...

After being dumped into the endless "Sea of Blood" following your humiliating transformation into a human you swim for an eternity before you finally bump your head against the pier of the keep. Digging your feet into the mud of human remains your hand brushes by an old blood-soaked shotgun, the previous owner's severed hand still attached to it. All who enter "Bloodsea Keep" with such items fall victim to your former advisor's favourite past-time: Torture. Any "heretics" still alive inside the keep should be homicidal maniacs at best.

"That's OK" you think, "maybe they brought some more ammo for the shotgun", before cocking the rusty pump-action, causing an eyeball to fly out of the cartridge...]]>

In Mephisto's Maosoleum you have reached the grave of an old friend and mentor: "Mephisto". Yeah old Lucy was a tough bastard. But then there was that incident with the earthling marine which lost him a lot of credit in the hard-core parts of Hell. So you had to kick him off the throne of course. His immortal spirit was kept as a member of the Cabal though and so he was in on the betrayal against you. Time to enter his tomb and lay the old man down to restfor good...]]>

<![CDATA[NESSUS is the 5th Canto in my INFERNO series. Minos decided to grant leniency and not kill you until next week.  In the meantime, having slipped past Cerberus, the top dog, you and Virgil come to a precipice overlooking the river Phlegethon. There, Virgil greets the Minotaur using phrases from an out-of-date "Passport to Demonese" by Charles Berlitz. Enraged at having been asked to remove his panties, the Minotaur falls upon the ground and throws a conniption fit. You grab Virgil and climb down some boulders to the foot of the cliff where Chiron, the chief Centaur, offers to have Nessus carry you across the river on his shoulders.
"Why, that's mighty white of ya'," says Virgil.
"No problem, sailor," says Nessus. "Hop on."

This is primarily a deathmatch level, but it's full of enough surprises to make single play quite challenging.]]>

In "Black Tower" you're nearing the end of your journey. You and Chagrin, the ruler of the Black Tower, came off the same conveyor belt as newly assembled cyber-demons a few thousand years back.
"Oil runs thicker than blood" the two of you used to say. Demons don't come much closer to friendship than what you and Chagrin shared. Well now your buddy rules the hordes of hell previously under your command and have left you for dead. Your task is simple: Enter the dreaded Black Tower, the nucleus of black magic and the occult in all of Hell, get to its highest floor and slay Chagrin. Then there is the getting back out as well...]]>

Of course you're out for revenge and have to kick the other members of the Cabal's butts one by one.

When the "Express Elevator to Hell" starts descending the renegade Cabal has begun to realize you might be a threat to them, human or not. Half way down the shaft that should have taken you to the deepest pits of Hell, the lift first slows down before it jerks to a halt. Ambush! Survive the initial onslaught and find a gateway out of the now sealed elevator. Tough, but that's the way you like it...

Number of Levels : Two. You'll have a  v e r y  hard time finding the secret level though >:) (there's a hint for you at bottom of this txt-file for if (when?) you give up).
The secret is called "Bad Dream". Try playing it from scratch...
